This repository is a supplement to the paper, **A Primer on Artificial Intelligence in Plant Digital Phenomics: Embarking on the Data to Insights Journey** (submitted to *Trends in Plant Science, 2021*) by by Antoine L. Harfouche, Farid Nakhle, Orlando G. Sardella, Antoine H. Harfouche, Eli Dart, and Daniel Jacobson. It aims to train, for the first time, an interpretable by design model to identify and classify cassava plant diseases, and to explain its predictions.

Read the accompanying paper [here](https://doi.org) (a link will be available once the paper is published).

The repository contains the python files for our implementation of the 'this looks like that' interpretable by design explainable artificial intelligence (X-AI) algorithm. In addition, this repository contains a tutorial hosted in an interactive notebook that can run on Google Colab or any other platform supporting Jupyter notebooks, aiming to help you use our implementation of the algorithm to train it to identify and classify cassava plant diseases, and to explain its predictions.
By the end of the tutorial, you should be able to apply the code and instructions to other datasets relevant to your research or project.

Access the tutorial [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HarfoucheLab/A-Primer-on-AI-in-Plant-Digital-Phenomics/blob/main/Tutorial.ipynb)

Our code include unit tests. We are working to increase the test coverage to cover all of the implemented functions.
To run the unit tests, use the following command:
python -m pytest

NB: pytest is required to run the tests. You might install it using pip (pip install pytest).

Finally, we have prepared a set of self-test quizzes in form of multiple-choice questions (MCQs), practices, and exercises to provide researchers with opportunities to augment their learning by testing the knowledge they have acquired and applying the concepts explained. Find the corresponding links below:
